### CVE-2017-8917

SQL injection vulnerability in Joomla! 3.7.x before 3.7.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.
=> Use the actual CVE script from exploitdb to exploit this, and then use the credentials with the script here to get a shell instantly!

#### Logic
    - The script will login with the specified credentials:
        - so you need to edit the script, and include the credentials for the site and also include your public IP address that will receive a reverse shell.
    - The script will store the session, then edit a template and then trigger the reverse shell connection back to you by visiting the edited template.
    - The template is edited, php code that sends a reverse shell back to the attacker is added.

#### Requirements
    - Python3
    - `python3 exploit.py ` : To run the script
    - `nc -nlvp 4444` : Set up a netcat listerner
