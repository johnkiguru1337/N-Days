# N-Days
This repository will include automation scripts for various CVEs


### Motivation
- I write this scripts to make my work easier, in case I have to exploit a target multiple times
- Most of this CVEs lack a specific automated script to do the exploitation


### CVEs
1. CVE-2017-8917 - Joomla SQL Vulnerability - After exploiting this CVE, use the credentials with this script to get a shell automatically! 
2. CVE-2018-12613 - phpMyAdmin 4.8.1 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
